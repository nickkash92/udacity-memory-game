## Instructions

The gameboard consists of 16 different playing cards faced down. The games objective is to have all 16 cards facing up in the quickest time possible. The only way to achieve this is by finding matching cards (same icon when faced up). When matching cards are idenified, the cards will remain facing up. 

Some other game details:

* The timer will start when you click the first card 
* Your score is based on the number of moves it takes to complete the board 

  - 3 stars (Complete in 12 moves or less)
  - 2 stars (Complete in 20 moves or less)
  - 1 star (Complete in more than 20 moves)
